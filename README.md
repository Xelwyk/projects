Showcase of my projects and other programs

## embedded projects

grohe carbonisator - OEM electronics replaced with ATmega series MCU, this software manages button press detection, temperature sensor readout, displaying data and menus on 16x2 LCD screen and relay control

garden watering - Made with Thinger.io IoT platform. Automated garden watering, light control, ambient pressure, temperature and humidity and soil temperature and humidity sensing. Requires minor fix because Thinger functions have some unexpected behavior when the dashboard is closed, other than that it works
